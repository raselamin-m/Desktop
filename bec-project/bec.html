                 <h3>History</h3><hr>
                    <p>
                        Barishal Engineering College was founded on 8 February 2018, with the approval from the University of Dhaka—a faculty exploring new frontiers of Science Engineering and Technology through academic search and development.[2] The main aim of the College is to expand engineering education (sourced from the Ministry of Education, Technical and Madrasa Education Department). The first students were admitted in 2018 for the 2017-18 session. Semester-based meritorious scholarships are awarded to 50% of admitted students. In the effort to revitalize Bangladesh into a middle-income economy, the government has projected to reach 20 percent technical and vocational education by 2020.[3]
